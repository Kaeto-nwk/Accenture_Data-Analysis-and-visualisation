## Project Overview 

This project aimed to analyse data for a media company called Social Buzz to provide insight into their users' activity and preferences. The project also aims to give recommendations for the company's expansion plans.

## Data sources

The dataset was provided by Accenture.
The cleaned dataset is available in the repository files. 


## Tools
 
Excel - Data Cleaning and Visualisations 

## Data Preparation 

- Removed Duplicates and Blank rows 
- utilized pivot tables to create visualisations 


## Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Analyse the consumer data to find the most popular content categories.

2. Identify the seasonal posting trends and patterns.

3. Analyse the overall sentiment of all content available on Social Buzz's platform.



## Results
1. Animals is the category with the highest aggregate score followed by science, healthy eating, and technology respectively. These top categories are educational.

2. Further analysis into the most popular content category shows that  most viewers are  either scared, peeking or hate the animal content. This is interesting as that is not the reaction expected of the most popular content category.

  Highest reaction to Animals Category – Scared

  Lowest reaction to Animals Category – Indifferent

3. Overall the sentiment towards the content available was 56% positive, 31% negative and 13% neutral which shows that more than half of users are pleased with the content they are being shown.

## Recommendations 

- Further research into why the no. of posts drastically increased between June and July 2020 and decreased between May and June 2021 to understand why there are sudden drops or increases in postings.
- Analysis of the 31% negative sentiment towards content to figure out why users are displeased with the content they are shown and  how to rectify the problem to improve overall sentiment.

## Limitations 
 - The data for the monthly posts is incomplete as 2020 is missing the months January to May and 2021 is missing the months July to December which means that I am unable to get a full picture of the monthly posts within a year and understand exactly which months tend to do the best.
